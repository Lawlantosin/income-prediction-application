# Income Prediction Application

## Introduction

This project is an income prediction application designed to classify individuals into income groups based on various features like age, education, marital status, and more. The application utilizes machine learning models trained with the PyCaret library and is deployed using Streamlit, making it interactive and user-friendly.

## Installation

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your system. After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy pycaret streamlit
```

Ensure you have the dataset `income.csv` placed in the correct directory as specified in your code.

## Usage

To start the application, navigate to the directory containing the Streamlit app script and run:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Replace `app.py` with the actual name of your Streamlit application script.

## Features

- Data preprocessing including handling missing values, normalizing data, and cleaning categorical variables.
- Training machine learning models using the PyCaret library.
- Comparison and tuning of multiple models to select the best performer based on F1 score.
- Deployment of the model through a Streamlit application for user interaction.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following main libraries:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- PyCaret
- Streamlit

## Configuration

No additional configuration is required beyond the installation steps. However, you may need to adjust the path to your dataset and model directory according to your local setup.
